#Hybrid Monte Carlo: Kramer's Algorithm

##To Do
 - Adapt/improve existing HMC routines
 - Create unit test: Simple Harmonic Oscillator
 - Extend the algorithm to include the Kramers condition
 - Lots of debugging
 - Create a second unit test: SHO

## About
This repository contains the code used to generate results for the thesis component of a Masters degree in Theoretical Physics at Edinburgh University
