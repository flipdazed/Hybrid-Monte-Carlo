Exponential Trajectory Lengths
======

Functions are generated from the `Mathematica` procedure in:

	../../../mathematicaDerivations/exponential/expFunctionDump.nb
which using a custom-script creates `C++` code from:

	../../../mathematicaDerivations/exponential/expFunctionDump.nb

Manually include into a file `../exponential.cpp` in
 the same format as [this guide](https://github.com/flipdazed/boost-python-hello-world)

See parent directory for details on compilation with `python`
