This directory contains a suggestion for the HMC code to 
for simulating the phi**4 theory with the HMC algorithm
as described in the lecture notes.

As in the ``start'' directory, compile with make and run with

phi4 infile

List of program files:

phi4.c       : main program
lattice.h    : contains global variables, the field and its dimensions
hopping.c    : initializes the hopping field
ranlxd.c     : Luescher's random number generator
gauss_rand.c : Routine to generate Gaussian random numbers, uses ranlux
measure.c    : Measurement routines for some observables
hmc.c        : Field update with the HMC algorithm
