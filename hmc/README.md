#Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)
This directory contains the HMC code and test cases.

##To Do
 - ~~Hamiltonian Dynamics: Leap-Frog Integration~~
 - ~~Unit Test: Simple Harmonic Oscillator~~
 - HMC Sampling
 - Unit Test: Bivariate Gaussian
 - *Code on GPU (if time) & Unit Test*
 - *Unit Test (if time): v. high-dim Gaussian*

## Unit Tests

### Hamiltonian Dynamics: Leap-Frog
